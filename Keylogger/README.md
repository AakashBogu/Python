 🔍 Python Keyboard Activity Monitor

A lightweight keyboard activity monitor built with Python and `pynput`. Captures and logs keystrokes in real time — built for learning how OS-level input event handling works.

## 🧠 How It Works

Your OS exposes a stream of input events. `pynput` taps into that stream via platform-specific APIs:

| Platform | Underlying API |
|----------|----------------|
| Windows  | Win32 API      |
| macOS    | Quartz / Core Graphics |
| Linux    | Xlib           |

The script registers two event callbacks:

- **`on_press(key)`** — fires the moment a key is pressed down; writes the key to a log file
- **`on_release(key)`** — fires when the key comes back up; stops the listener when `ESC` is pressed

Alphanumeric keys carry a `.char` attribute (e.g., `'a'`, `'5'`). Special keys like `Shift`, `Enter`, and `Esc` don't — so they're caught via `AttributeError` and written in bracket notation: `[Key.enter]`.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aakashbogu/keylogger.git
cd keylogger
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pynput
```

### 3. Run

```bash
python keylogger.py
```

Keystrokes are logged to `log.txt` in real time. Press **`ESC`** to stop.

## 📄 Sample Output (`log.txt`)

```
hello [Key.space] everyone [Key.enter] this [Key.space] is [Key.space] a [Key.space] test [Key.esc]
```

## 💡 What This Teaches

- How operating systems expose input events to user-space programs
- Event-driven programming with callback functions
- Handling exceptions for type-based branching 
- Real-time file I/O with append mode

This is the same core mechanism used in:
- Accessibility tools (screen readers, switch access)
- Hotkey managers (AutoHotkey, Hammerspoon)
- Automation frameworks (PyAutoGUI, Selenium)
